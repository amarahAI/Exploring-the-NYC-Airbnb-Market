# Exploring-the-NYC-Airbnb-Market

NYC is one of the most-visited cities in the world. As a result, there are many Airbnb listings to meet the high demand for temporary lodging for anywhere between a few nights to many months.

This project involved data importing and cleaning skills to uncover insights into the Airbnb market in New York City. 

Our goals are to convert untidy data into appropriate formats to analyze, and answer key questions including:

What is the average price, per night, of an Airbnb listing in NYC?
How does the average price of an Airbnb listing, per month, compare to the private rental market?
How many adverts are for private rooms?
How do Airbnb listing prices compare across the five NYC boroughs?
